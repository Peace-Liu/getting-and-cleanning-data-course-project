### Identifier
- subjectId: identifies the subject who performed the activity.
- activitynames: derived from activitylabel.txt linked by activityId, the type of activities performed when the measures were taken.

### Activity Labels
- WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
